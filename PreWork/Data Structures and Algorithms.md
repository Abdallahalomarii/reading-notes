# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Basic Recursion
- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
## Data Structures
- This video provides a quick overview of various fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. It explains their basic operations, advantages, and use cases, giving you a glimpse into the different ways data can be organized and manipulated.

## Big O Explained
-  Big O notation is a way to analyze and describe the efficiency of algorithms. This video explains the concept of Big O notation and its significance in understanding algorithmic time complexity. It covers common time complexities like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2), providing insights into how algorithm performance scales with input size.

## Basic Data Structures
-  This reading introduces basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables. It explains their characteristics, operations, and trade-offs, allowing you to understand when and how to use each data structure effectively.

## Why Big O 
- This reading focuses on the importance of understanding Big O notation when analyzing and comparing algorithms. It explains how Big O notation provides a standardized way to express algorithmic efficiency, helping programmers make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization.

## things i  want to know more about 

- Linked list,List Aueue, Stack : i'm understanding it but for some reason i forget all about it and i have to study more about it.
- the recusion function and the thing i really want to know more about it and every time i study it i got confuesed.
