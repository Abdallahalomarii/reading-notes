### Act like you have 1000$ per Hour.

- Your time is worth for you deep in your heart you know you can't lose your time because it's important for you.

    - dont waste your time 
      your time is vauleable and in every moment you should stay focused and doing the important things. act like your hour is fro 1000 bucks.

    - You teach people how to treat you.

    - If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.

    - But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.
     What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.
    - But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable.

    - People will recognize that.

    - People will respect that.

    - People will treat you differently.


    - **You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them**.

- ### How to think like a programmer

     - You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??

    - Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

    - lets say we all have problems to solve the problems you have to do some steps.

        - try a solution. 
        - if it dosn't work try another.
        - if it dosn't work do step 2 until it works.
    
    - Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

- so how to solve a problem in correct the way ? 
    - Understand the problem. 
        - Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.

        - explain the problem in your language that how you know you understanding the problem!
    - plan how to solve this problem before coding.
        - Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
        - In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
    - divide your problem to parts to solve it easly. 
        - Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

        - Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

        - then solve each sub-problem by its own and when you finish solving the subs connect all subs to give you the final result!
    - you may stuck in any sub of your problems that's fair 
    without fail you can't learn.

        - Debug  go step by step in your code to find where did you got stuck

        - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

        - resarch : search in google for solving of this problem you faced you may find someone who solve something like this and keep in mind to understand the solve of this problem and how the code working then try typing it by yourslef !.

- ### the 5 whys 

    - You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

    - How to Use the 5 Whys ? 

        1.  Assemble a Team: Bring together a group of people who have knowledge and experience related to the problem. This team will work collaboratively to find the root cause and develop effective solutions.

        2. Define the Problem: Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve. Write a concise problem statement that everyone agrees on. This statement should describe the issue accurately and provide a starting point for the analysis.

        3. Ask the First "Why?": Start by asking why the problem is occurring. This question prompts the team to investigate the immediate cause or symptom of the problem. The answer should be based on factual information rather than speculation.

        4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times: For each answer obtained in Step 3, ask "Why?" again, using the previous answer as a starting point. Repeat this process at least four times to dig deeper into the underlying causes of the problem. By doing so, you uncover multiple layers of causality.

        5. Know When to Stop: Stop asking "Why?" when you have reached a point where additional questioning does not produce useful responses. This indicates that you have likely identified the root cause of the problem.
        
        6. Address the Root Cause: Once you have identified the root cause, focus on developing counter-measures or solutions that directly target the underlying issue. These actions should prevent the problem from recurring in the future.

        7. Monitor Your Measures: Implement the counter-measures or solutions and closely monitor their effectiveness. Continuously evaluate and adjust these measures as needed to ensure they effectively address the root cause and eliminate or minimize the problem.
    - Starting with a fact, you first ask the question, "So what?" – in other words, what are the implications of that fact? Why is this fact important? 
    
    - You then continue asking that question until you've drawn all possible conclusions from it.
       
- ## things i want to lnow more about 
    - solving high complxity problems without any conflict and stuck 
    - and the mind that makes me keep in my heart that my every hour worth more than i think.
