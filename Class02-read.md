### 1- name 3 ways in which unit testing imporves your codebase and productivly :

-  can identify a bug and errors early than the dev cycle, before go to other part in app, saving money , time,cost of fixing bugs.
- unit test give high quality of functions and ensure all function are corectlly clear and as expected. and can prevent unxpected errors.

- steps it may work dpend on my understanding from the article : 
    - first i have to create a test name should be clear and understood.
        based on arrange and act and assert : first i have to arrange the clothes that is clear and ready to put them away.
     - then the act phase came which i have to pick one of clothing and where i want to store it and putting it in right location and repating these steps to finish all the clothes.
     - next i want to start with assert phase so i have to check there is no clothes left behind, all in right location, and checking if i lost some of clothes behind or missing, and then i will check if the place where is stored the clothes is organized and filled correctly.
