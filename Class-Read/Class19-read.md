#  Roles, Claims and JWT Tokens

## Claims-Based Authentication

Claims-Based Authentication is a fundamental concept for building robust authentication and authorization systems. It allows you to go beyond traditional role-based access control and tailor user permissions based on specific attributes. By understanding claims, you can create a more personalized and secure user experience within your applications.

### Why It Matters
Claims-Based Authentication matters because:
- It provides fine-grained control over user access.
- Users can have dynamic and context-rich permissions.
- Applications can be more adaptable to different user scenarios.


## Introduction to Claims

Understanding claims is crucial for implementing effective authentication and authorization systems. Claims provide context about a user's identity and attributes, allowing for more nuanced decision-making when determining access rights. 

### Why It Matters
Introduction to Claims matters because:
- Claims enrich the user's profile with relevant information.
- They facilitate dynamic access control.
- Claims are at the core of token-based authentication.

## JWT Authentication

JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication is a powerful method for securing your applications, especially APIs, in a stateless manner. Understanding how JWT tokens work and their role in authentication and authorization is essential for building secure and scalable systems.

### Why It Matters
JWT Authentication matters because:
- It enables secure communication between clients and servers.
- Tokens carry claims, minimizing database lookups.
- JWT is widely used for single sign-on (SSO) and securing APIs.
