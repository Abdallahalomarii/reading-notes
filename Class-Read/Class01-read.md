# Class01-Read Try/Catch

- ## Name one major benefit of being able to trace the call stack :-
    - identifying the code errors and tracing how the code working and aunderstanding it, and troubleshoot the issues in the code.

- ## If you could use try/catch in your day to day life, name an exception you’d like to ‘catch’ and handle.

    - Format Exception : one of the most popular error that occurs when working on console app and when the app reading from the user so the user may input some thing wrong that not realtive to the code like if he inputed an integere while the app accept only strings one of theses examples. 

- ## From an efficiency standpoint, are there downsides to try/catch blocks?
    
    - one of theses downsides of try/catch blokcs when a issue occurs it sometime will be difficult to understand what's happening on the program because the tacing will be jumping to different locations on the code which makes it hard to read, and the exception handling can include the cycle on CPU and memory usage cost.

- ## Describe how you explain the .Net approach to exception handling to a non technical friend.

    - imagine the exception handling on .NET is a employee on clothes shop and he want to filter all clothes he got in one container, the container inlcudes baby clothes, men's colthes and woman's colthes so each of them has a part and he want to put only the baby's clothes  and he don't know what this container has, so he will start looking one by one and when anything not related to baby's he will put them on another place and notice someone to do it.

- ## Name glaring mistakes that were made during the production of these systems.

    - Therac-25 : There were no comprehensive tests or simulations performed to ensure that the machine operated correctly and safely under all conditions. This lack of testing failed to catch critical flaws in the system's software.

    - Ariane-5 : The software responsible for controlling the rocket's inertial reference system (IRS) was not adapted properly for the new and more powerful Ariane 5. The faster and larger numbers produced during the IRS calculation caused an arithmetic overflow, leading to the rocket's onboard computer system shutting down and the subsequent loss of the mission.
    The system did not handle the exception caused by the arithmetic overflow correctly

- ## things i want to know more about:
    - The all exceptions on try/catch 
    - How to test all cases in code
    - make a clear code that follow all the rules.
