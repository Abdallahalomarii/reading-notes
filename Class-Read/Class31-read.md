# Razore pages

- ### Razor pages

  - Razor Pages is a web development framework introduced in ASP.NET Core, designed to simplify the creation of web applications.

  - It focuses on building web pages using a more page-centric approach, where each page has its own code and markup.

  - Razor Pages are well-suited for scenarios where the application's structure follows a straightforward page-based flow, such as a blog or a content-based website.

  - They emphasize convention over configuration, making it easier to get started quickly.

- ### MVC

  - MVC is a traditional web development pattern that separates an application into three components: Model, View, and Controller

  - It provides a more structured approach to building web applications, with controllers handling user input, models representing data, and views rendering the user interface.

  - MVC is often used for complex and large-scale applications where the separation of concerns is crucial.

- ### Comparison

  - The pros and cons of Razor Pages compared to MVC.

  - Razor Pages are praised for their simplicity and ease of use, making them a good choice for smaller projects and developers who prefer a more straightforward approach.

  - MVC, on the other hand, offers greater flexibility and control, making it suitable for larger, more complex applications.

  - The choice between Razor Pages and MVC depends on the specific needs of the project, developer preferences, and the level of control required over the application's structure.

- ### summary

  - Razor Pages and MVC are two different approaches to web development in ASP.NET Core, each with its own strengths and use cases. Razor Pages are simpler and more page-centric, while MVC offers greater control and separation of concerns, making them suitable for different types of projects. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the web application being developed.
