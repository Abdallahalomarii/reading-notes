- ## Inheritance:
 Inheritance in C# allows new classes to be created based on existing classes, enabling code reuse and extending behavior. It establishes a hierarchical relationship where derived classes inherit the properties, methods, and behaviors of their base classes. This promotes modularity, flexibility, and the ability to create specialized classes representing different levels of abstraction.

- ## Abstract: 
In C#, the abstract keyword is used to create classes or class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and provide a common definition for derived classes to share, while abstract methods have no implementation and must be implemented by derived classes.

- ## Polymorphism:
  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms or behaviors. In C#, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a derived class to provide its own implementation of a method defined in the base class. Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist in the same class.

- ## Encapsulation:
   is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and methods into a single unit called a class. It allows the data to be hidden and accessed only through the defined methods, providing a protective barrier around the internal state of an object. This promotes modularity, code organization, and information hiding, ultimately leading to more robust and maintainable software systems.

- ## Things I want to know more about :
    - is how to make inheritance in C# and how to use in c++ i remember i was typing the inheratance word in class defination, 
        and i want to learn more about OOP almost forget it but still remember some rules and concepts, how to deal with child class or derived , the polymorphism this thing i didn't got it from the univercity days. still wanna more about it.
