# React 1 Reading Notes

## ES6 Overview

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several important features to JavaScript. Key points to remember:

- Arrow functions for concise function declarations.
- `let` and `const` for variable declarations with block scope.
- Template literals for string interpolation.
- Destructuring for extracting values from objects and arrays.

## React - Hello World

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Starting with a "Hello World" example is a common way to get acquainted with React. Key takeaways:

- React components are the building blocks of the UI.
- The `ReactDOM.render()` method is used to render a React component into the DOM.

## React - JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React. Key points include:

- JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
- JSX elements are transformed into React elements during compilation.
- You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces `{}`.

## React - Rendering Elements

React elements are the smallest building blocks of React applications. Important concepts include:

- React elements are immutable and describe what the UI should look like.
- The `ReactDOM.render()` method renders React elements into the DOM.
- React elements are created with JSX.

## React - Components & Props

React components allow you to split the UI into reusable and independent parts. Key takeaways:

- Components are reusable and can have their state and properties (props).
- Props allow you to pass data from parent to child components.
- Component composition is a core concept in React.


## React - State & Lifecycle

State management and component lifecycle are crucial aspects of React. Key points include:

- State represents data that can change over time.
- The `setState()` method is used to update component state.
- Components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount()` for side effects.

## React - Handling Events

React allows you to handle events in a declarative manner. Important concepts include:

- Events in React are named using camelCase, like `onClick` and `onChange`.
- Event handlers are functions that can be assigned to event attributes.
- Event handling in React is similar to handling events in standard HTML.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the development process. Key takeaways:

- Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes for styling HTML elements.
- You can customize Tailwind's utility classes to match your project's design.
- Tailwind promotes a responsive and maintainable CSS development approach.

## Next.js

Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications. Key points to consider:

- Next.js simplifies server-side rendering, routing, and API integration.
- It offers fast and optimized performance out of the box.
- Next.js is a great choice for building production-ready React applications.
